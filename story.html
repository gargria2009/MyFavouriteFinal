        <p>
            It was the day before Halloween and I was walking home with my best friends, Oak and Ava. Tomorrow, we were going to go Trick-or-Treating and we already had our map planned out! We have been looking forward to Halloween for a long time and now it’s finally here! I’m going to be dressing as Thing 1, Ava will be Thing 2, and Oak is going to be Thing 3. I’m so excited about Halloween. I can’t wait!
            <br/> 
            “Bye mom,” I said as I waved to my Mom. 
            <br/>
            When I got to class, I spotted Ava and Oak chatting in the back of the room and I walked up to them.
            <br/>
            “Hi, Ivy! Are you excited about tomorrow?!” Oak asked. 
            <br/>
            “Who wouldn't be?” I responded.
            <br/>
            Oak smiled knowingly as she turned back to the front of the class.
            <br/>
            During class, I could feel the buzz of excitement for the next night when we were free to go home. Ava, Oak, and I went to my house and tried on our costumes for the next night. Soon, they had to go home and I had to go to bed. We said goodbye and we were all looking forward to tomorrow. Little did I know...it would be the worst day of our lives.
            <br/>
             After school, the next day, Oak and Ava both met at my house and we were all buzzing with excitement for the night ahead of us. When we were finished wearing our costumes, we took some photos of us in our costumes, and then we took our pillowcases into the night.
            <br/>
            When we did about 10 houses, our pillowcases were about ⅕ full and we were ready for more! When we stopped at 5691 Abandoned Road, it was ironic because I’ve never seen anyone come out of the road but anything for candy, come chills went through me and I knew Ava and Oak felt it too...
            <br/>
             *Knock Knock*
            <br/>
            I knocked at the doorstep of the creepy old house and stepped back. 
            <br/>
            “Eeeeeee,” The door squeaked open
            <br/>
             My mind urged me to step inside eager to know what was happening in there. Oak and Ava followed behind me and whispered.
            <br/>
            “Ivy, what are you doing? Ivy, stop!” Ava yelled.
            <br/>
            When we got into the house, there was no one there. Then all of a sudden, out of nowhere, some moonlight came into the house, displaying more of the house. When my eyes landed on a creepy doll lying on the floor in the corner, my feet scurried towards it without warning. After glancing at the doll, Ava and Oak shivered with fear and went towards the door and called me to follow. 
            <br/>
            *SLAM*
            <br/>
            The door closed behind them and they got pushed onto the wall. Surprised, I ran over to help them up. When we returned to the corner of the room, my mouth hung wide open--the doll had disappeared!

            <br/>
            *BOOM*
            <br/>
            Lightning went through the sky, and we turned around to see a hole in the wall and a small figure came waddling towards us. At first, I couldn't figure out what it was but then I saw the familiar creepy doll face.
            <br/>
            “Hahahaha, I will get you all and when I do, I’ll have the perfect doll army to take over the world!”
            <br/>
            Agape, I stood there looking at the hideous thing. It reminded me of a Halloween doll I used to have when I was younger; what was it called again? ...oh yes, Bloody Beth. I can’t believe we were trapped here all alone. What did she mean by a doll army?
            <br/>
            As if reading my brain, the doll answered, “Whenever I kill one of you, you will turn into a doll and I will get all of you and then take over the world! Ahahaha!”
            <br/>
            “RUN!” I screamed.
            <br/>
            We all ran in different directions as the doll chased after us. She had an eerie look on her face, which made me run faster.
            <br/>
            “AHhHhH” I heard someone scream. It sounded like Ava?!
            <br/>
            Oak and I ran back to the center of the house and gasped at Ava; she passed out, or so it seems. White waves formed around her and she was gone, but then I saw a small little doll walking towards us…then I remembered what the doll had said. “Whenever I kill one of you, you will turn into a doll and I will get all of you and then take over the world.” I shuddered at the thought, would this be the end? Ava was already gone and Oak and I teared up that one of our best friends was fighting us now.
            <br/>
            For some reason, I couldn’t figure out what but this thing that’s happening to us sounds familiar. I feel like I have heard a story about it before. Then it hit me, maybe this story that I read is coming to life! Maybe if I can remember what happened in the story and do the same here, this might all over! Trying to go back to that moment in time I remembered and I knew how to stop this doll from doing any more harm than it already has.
            <br/>
             ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~
            <br/>
            As I whispered the plan into Oak’s ear I wondered what the doll was doing right now probably planning with Ava, I wish Ava got away. When I told Oak the plan she was dazed.
            <br/>
            “What?! How will we do that?!” She questioned
            <br/>
            “It’s our only hope, we have to try,” I responded bravely.
            <br/>
            We silently walked into the darkness trying to find the dolls so our plan will go through. When we heard the doll’s disturbing creepy voice a grim smile appeared on my face and I was so ready to get this over with. The way to get rid of the doll is to stab it in the heart and then the doll will vanish forever. I was going to be the one to distract the doll and Oak was going to stab her in the heart with the pointy spear we found in the kitchen.
            <br/>
            “Make our friend back to normal right this instance or else...”
            <br/>
            “Or else what?” She sputtered back
            <br/>
            “Or else I’ll call the cops!” I said my confidence decreasing as time passed
            <br/>
            “Haha, what will they do? Go ahead, call the cops, just more people to add to my doll army,” She laughed.
            <br/>
            Suddenly I saw black goo coming out of the doll and I knew Oak had gone through with the plan had worked.
            <br/>
            “AHhHaHhH'' she screamed then a white fog circling her.
            <br/>
            *POOF*
            <br/>
            Just like that, she disappeared into thin air leaving the Ava doll with us. Suddenly a white poof came around Ava and the familiar face came up in front of me.
            <br/>
            “AVA!” Oak and I exclaimed.
            <br/>
            “That was so scary… my mind was making me do stuff that I didn’t want to do it was like being forced to do something. I’m glad that I’m back to normal though. Can we please just go home now?”
            <br/>
            “Yea, let’s just go home and watch a movie and eat the candy that we got.”
            <br/>
            When we reached the front door I knocked but it just flew open. A chill went down my spine my home felt different it felt like it wasent my house..
            <br/>
            “Mom?! Dad?! Karla?!” I Screeched
            <br/>
            I looked around everywhere for them, their bedroom, the kitchen, the washing room, all the bedrooms yet they were no-where to be seen when i went to check the living room I screamed at what I saw- 3 beth dolls sitting on the couch that looked just like my sister my mom and my dad....
